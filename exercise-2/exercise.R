# Exercise 2: writing and executing functions (II)

# Define a function `CompareLength` that takes in 2 character strings, and returns
# the sentence of the form
#   "The difference in length is N"
length <- paste("The difference in length is")
number <- 3
CompareLength <- function(length, number)

# Pass two strings of different lengths to your `CompareLength` function
Com

# Define a function `DescribeDifference` that will return one of the following statements:
# "Your first string is longer by N characters"
# "Your second string is longer by N characters"

DescribeDifference <- function(first,second)
first <- paste("Your first string is longer by N characters")
second <- paste("Your second string is longer by N characters")
